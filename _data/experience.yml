    Developing Web Api and Web App using ASP.NET as framework with. The Web Api and Web App are using Onion Architecture for clean, scalable, and easy to maintain applications.

    I gained knowledge in various aspects of the .NET framework. I learned about .NET MVC, HTTP, and REST API development. Additionally, I worked with an application that utilized the Onion Architecture with Dapper, which provided a modular and maintainable code structure. I also gained experience in developing secure API with Identity Server and also learned SQL and Transact SQL for database transactions.

    I had the opportunity to work on an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) Software system, with the latest technologies in the .NET ecosystem. Specifically, I utilized .NET 6.0, which provided me with access to the latest features and enhancements in the framework. Additionally, I gained experience in front-end development using Vue.js, a popular JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Furthermore, I worked with PostgreSQL as the database management system, honing my skills in data modeling, querying, and optimizing database operations. This hands-on experience allowed me to apply my theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios and further strengthen my expertise in the .NET stack.
